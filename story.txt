Fox changed a new job suddenly busy up, which makes before can have a lot of time to accompany the rabbit is not used to. He made the coffee for fox and put it on the table. He watched the fox scratching at the keyboard for some documents he could not understand. The rabbit sighed and poked at the fox with his paw. The little fox did not take his eyes off the computer, leaving a paw to pat the little rabbit on the head: "darling, stop that now, soon finished."
Fox had no time for silly interactions. He had a lot of work he needed to get done. Little rabbit left him to do his work and by morning he had finally finished. He was so tired that he had no energy to talk to the rabbit anymore which made the little rabbit very sad.
Little rabbit realized that he shouldn't bother Fox anymore, but he really wanted a friend to have some fun with. Little rabbit retreated into the corner of the living room and sat there playing with his toys alone. Fox glanced up wearily and noticed the sadness etched into little rabbit's face. Something in Fox's heart twinged, and Fox decided to join little rabbit.
